# Salary Prediction Challenge Kaggle


The challenge objective: tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. 

I decided to bo both the data exploration and build a predictive model using logistic regression to predict the salaries of survey participants.

This project involved:
- Data cleaning, wrangling and manipulation
- Imputation of missing values 
- Statistical Analysis 
- Data exploration
- Visualization
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analyisis
